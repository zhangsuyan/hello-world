                                                        Introduction
   Priciples are concepts that can be applied over and over again in similar circumstances as distinct from narrow answers to specific questions. Every game has principles that successful players master to achive winning rusults. So does life.Principles are ways of successfully dealing with the laws of nature or the laws of life. Those who understand more of them and understand them well know how to interact with the world more effectively than those who know fewer of them or know them less well.Different aspects of life-e.g.,there are "parenting principles" or skiing, "parenting principles" for parenting, "managment principles" for managing, "investment principles" for investing, etc - and there are over-arching "life principles" that influence our approaches to all things. And, of course, different people subscribe to different principles that they believe work best.
   I am confident that whatever success Bridgewater and I have had has resulted from our operating by certain principles. Creating a great culture, finding the right people, managing them to do great things and solving problems creatively and systematically are challengs faced by all organizations. What differentiates them is how they approach these challenges. The pinciples laid out in the pages that follow convey our unique results. Bridgewater's success has rusulted from talented people operating by the principles set out here, and it will continue to operate by them. Like getting fit, virtually anyone can do it if they are willing to do what it takes.
