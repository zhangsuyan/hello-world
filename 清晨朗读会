        33 Business is Creative by Derek Sivers
 Do not turn off your creativity when doing business.
 Business is an creative as music.
 I see so many musicians who are wildly creative when writing ,playing, performing, and recording. But as soon as it's time to make some money, they clam up, get stiff, and lose all of their confidence.
 They pick up a book that tells them exactly how to make a website, exactly how to write an email, exactly what to say when making a call. They do everything exactly as told.
 To understand how silly this is, imagine a business- preson who has worked in an office for 20 years that starts doing music at the age of 50. They're scared and new so they try to do everything right. They play the "right" chords, the "safe" lyrics, and everything is boring and stiff. They are making music only like the book told them to do. They take mo chances.
 That's how musicians look when getting into business. They turn off their creativity and try to do everything "safe". But that's the worst thing you can do.
 Loosen up. Get confident, creative, playful, experimental. Break the rules. Do exactly what you're not supposed to.
 Think of how comfortable you are on your instrument. Riffing.Improvising. Playing. Having fun with it.
 Now be that comfortable in your apporch to business, promotion, marketing. Riff. Improvise. Play. Have fun with it.
 Do with your business what you would tell a new, scared musician to do with their instrument.
 
       34 Gettysburg Address by Abraham Lincoln
 Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation,conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
 Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle- field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
 But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate - we can not consecrate- we can not hallow - this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinshed work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us - that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they these dead whall not have died in vain- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom - and that government for the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
